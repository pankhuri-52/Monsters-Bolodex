# Getting Started with Create React App
The entry point for any react-app is index.js file inside src folder.
root -> index.html
Babel -> It takes the code and condenses the index.html into something that browser(very basic javascript) can understand.
WebPack -> Turns the javascript into smaller chunks so that whenever user demands a certain page, he only gets that chunk of javascript (modularising the code).
npm run eject -> we can modify the babel and webpack for certain usecases.

React is just a combination of components which are made of HTML, CSS and javascript.

HOOKS v/s CLASSES
Hooks -> react-specific
Classes -> mostly used in javascript.
